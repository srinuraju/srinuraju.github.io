<h2>Project 3 — Data Quality, Monitoring & Pipeline Observability</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
  This project focused on improving data quality and observability across batch data pipelines,
  with the goal of detecting issues early and reducing operational surprises in production.
</p>

<h3>What needed to be solved</h3>
<p>
  Data issues were often detected downstream, after reports were already impacted.
  Failures were visible, but data correctness issues such as partial loads, schema drift,
  or unexpected volume changes were harder to catch proactively.
</p>

<h3>How quality checks were implemented</h3>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Defined baseline expectations for schema, volume, and freshness.</li>
  <li>Added validation steps as part of pipeline execution.</li>
  <li>Used <strong>SQL-based checks</strong> in Athena to validate key assumptions.</li>
  <li>Ensured checks ran before downstream datasets were published.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Monitoring and alerting</h3>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Pipeline failures and validation errors surfaced through alerts.</li>
  <li>Missing or delayed partitions flagged as potential SLA risks.</li>
  <li>Logs centralized to support faster root-cause analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Operating in production</h3>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Runbooks documented common data quality and pipeline issues.</li>
  <li>Clear escalation paths established for data incidents.</li>
  <li>Reduced reliance on manual checks and downstream detection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Impact on reliability</h3>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Earlier detection of data issues before they reached consumers.</li>
  <li>Improved confidence in downstream analytics and reports.</li>
  <li>Lower operational overhead during on-call and support rotations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
  The addition of structured data quality checks and monitoring improved overall pipeline reliability.
  Issues were detected closer to the source, reducing downstream rework and increasing trust
  in published datasets.
</p>

<h3>What I’d improve next</h3>
<ul class="bullets">
  <li>Introduce dataset-level SLAs with automated tracking.</li>
  <li>Expand anomaly detection beyond basic volume checks.</li>
  <li>Add lineage visibility to better understand downstream impact.</li>
</ul>
